# What is CNN
- Neural network that has one or more convolutional layers.
- Neural network (Input layer -> hidden later -> output layer) (Like human neurons )
- Convolutional layers 
    -are the layers where filters are applied to the original image or to other features maps in a deep CNN.
    - “looking at a function’s surroundings to make better/accurate predictions of its outcome.” 
- Convolution is essentially sliding a filter over the input.
- Features -> points/data/sections.
- Kernel 
    -  the kernel is nothing but a filter that is used to extract the features from the images. The kernel is a matrix that moves over the input data, performs the dot product with the sub-region of input data, and gets the output as the matrix of dot products.
    - Each convolutional layer contains a series of filters known as convolutional kernels. The filter is a matrix of integers that are used on a subset of the input pixel values, the same size as the kernel. Each pixel is multiplied by the corresponding value in the kernel, then the result is summed up for a single value for simplicity representing a grid cell, like a pixel, in the output channel/feature map
